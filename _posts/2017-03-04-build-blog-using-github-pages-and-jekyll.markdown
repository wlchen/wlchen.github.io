- Follow the instructions from GitHub Pages to create the repository: https://pages.github.com/

- Follow the qluick-start guide on the Jekyll website: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/
  - I have no problems on my Mac, but got problems on Ubuntu cause the Ruby version must be 2.0 and above. Just use the following commands to update your Ruby.
	
    - `apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng`
    - `apt-get update`
    - `apt-get install ruby2.2`

- Now you can add posts simply by creating markdown files in the "_posts" folder with the same format as the example. http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/ 
- You can preview the post by running the following command and browse locally at http://localhost:4000
 
    - `bundle exec jekyll serve`
